# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Contract Address for Storage smart contract on sepolia eth
**0xAc9852745094AEEa3648af6ee9dc6d780b811c56**

Contract Address for Storage smart contract on sepolia eth
****


```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
